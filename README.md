#### Skeleton of  ####

```
// This is a simple  program. 
class HelloWorld  { 
	// Your program begins with a call to main(). 
	// Prints "Hello, World".
	public static void main(String args[]) { 
		System.out.println("Hello, World"); 
	} 
} 
```

#### OOPs ####

`OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)` Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

1. Object
2. Class
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism

`Object` - Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object
`Class` - class is a  blueprint  or Collection of objects
`Encapsulation` - Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit
`Abstraction` - Hiding internal details and showing functionality
`Inheritance`- When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent objec
`Polymorphism` - If one task is performed in different ways


##### Inheritance #####
There are three types of constructors in Java:
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance

#### Constructor ####
A constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.

There are two types of constructors in Java:
1. Default constructor (no-arg constructor)
2. Parameterized constructor

#### This Keyword ####
`this` - this is a reference variable that refers to the current object

#### Method Overloading  ####
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

#### Method Overriding  ####
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.
